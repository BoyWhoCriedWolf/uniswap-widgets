The `@sunmoon11100/uniswap-widgets` package is an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sunmoon11100/uniswap-widgets) of React components used to provide subsets of the Uniswap Protocol functionality in a small and configurable user interface element.

# Uniswap Labs Swap Widget

The Swap Widget bundles the whole swapping experience into a single React component that developers can easily embed in their app with one line of code. 

You can customize the theme (colors, fonts, border radius, and more) to match the style of your application. You can also configure your own default token list and optionally set a convenience fee on swaps executed through the widget on your site.

## Installation

Install the widgets library via `npm` or `yarn`.

```shell
yarn add @sunmoon11100/uniswap-widgets
```
```shell
npm i --save @sunmoon11100/uniswap-widgets
